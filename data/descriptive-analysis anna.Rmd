## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)       
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(tidyr)
```

## Loading & Saving data

For the data cleaning part, please refer to the Python Notebook 'data-cleaning.ipynb'.

```{r}
dt.startup.invest <- fread("unicorn-clean.csv")

# Count how many investors each company has
dt.startup.invest[, n_investors := .N, by=list(Company, year)]

# Average invest per investor
dt.startup.invest$avg_invest <- dt.startup.invest$BValuation / dt.startup.invest$n_investors

# Save dt.startup.invest
save(dt.startup.invest, file="dt.startup.invest.RData")
```

Loading the data:

```{r}
load('dt.startup.invest.RData')

# Creating datatable with distinct companies, summarizing investors
dt.startup <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  summarize(investors = list(investor), year = mean(year), BValuation = mean(BValuation), 
            n_investors = mean(n_investors), avg_invest = mean(avg_invest)) %>%
  unique()
```

## General insights


#### Do big investors invest in the same startups?
```{r}
# How many startups are there?
sprintf('The total number of startups in the dataset is %d', nrow(dt.startup))

# Which investor invests the most on average?
top.avg.investor <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(investor) %>%
  summarize(avg_investment = mean(avg_invest)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_investment)) %>%
  head(1)
sprintf('The investor with the highest average investment is %s with an average of %f billion dollars', top.avg.investor$investor, top.avg.investor$avg_investment)

# Which investor invests the most in total?
top.total.investor <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(investor) %>%
  summarize(total_investment = sum(avg_invest)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_investment)) %>%
  head(1)
sprintf('The investor with the highest total investment is %s with a total of %f billion dollars', top.total.investor$investor, top.total.investor$total_investment)

# Is there a startup in which the three biggest investors invested?
top.3.total.investor <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(investor) %>%
  summarize(total_investment = sum(avg_invest)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_investment)) %>%
  head(3)

seq.cap.china <- dt.startup.invest[dt.startup.invest$investor == 'Sequoia Capital China']$Company
seq.cap <- dt.startup.invest[dt.startup.invest$investor == 'Sequoia Capital']$Company
kho.ven <- dt.startup.invest[dt.startup.invest$investor == 'Khosla Ventures']$Company

startup.intersect <- Reduce(intersect, list(seq.cap, seq.cap.china, kho.ven))
sprintf('There are %d startups the three biggest investors intersected in.', length(startup.intersect))
```
#### Number of investments & startups per year
```{r}
# Number of startups per year & accumulated
n.startups <- dt.startup %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n_startups = n()) %>%
  mutate(csum_n_startups = cumsum(n_startups))
n.startups

# Number of investments per year & accumulated
n.invest <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n_startups = n()) %>%
  mutate(csum_n_startups = cumsum(n_startups))
n.invest
```
#### What is the year with the highest number of investments made by a single investor?

```{r}
top.invest.year <- dt.startup.invest %>%
  group_by(year, investor) %>%
  summarize(n_investments = n(), sum_investment = sum(avg_invest), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_investments)) %>%
  head(1)
sprintf('The year with the highest number og investments made by a single investor is %d by %s with a total of $%f (in billion) in %d investments', top.invest.year$year, top.invest.year$investor, top.invest.year$sum_investment, top.invest.year$n_investments)

```

#### Most popular startups (according to valuation)

```{r}
# Top 10% most popular startups
val.threshold <- quantile(dt.startup$BValuation, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)
dt.startups.popular <- subset(dt.startup.invest, BValuation >= val.threshold)

# Top 10 investors
invest.popular.10 <- dt.startups.popular %>%
  group_by(investor) %>%
  summarize(n_investments = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_investments)) %>%
  head(10)
invest.popular.10
```

### Plotting data
```{r}
# Number of new startups per year
# Subset data --------------------------
dt.startup.year <- select(dt.startup, year)

# Plot data ----------------------------
ggplot(dt.startup.year, aes(x = year)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + labs(title = "Number of Startups per Year", x = "Year", y = "Number of Startups")

```

```{r}
# Subset data ----------------------------
dt.invest.year <- select(dt.startup, BValuation)

# Plot data ------------------------------
ggplot(dt.invest.year, aes(x = BValuation)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) + scale_x_log10() + labs(title = "Distribution of Startup Valuation", x = "Valuation (log)", y = "Number of Investments")

```
### Investors investing in the top 50 most popular startups

```{r}
# Subset data
startup.50 <- dt.startup.invest[ , .N, by = list(Company, BValuation)]
startup.50 <- startup.50[order(-BValuation)][1:50, Company]

# List of all actors to find movies with these actors
l.investor.startup.50 <- dt.startup.invest[Company %in% startup.50, unique(investor)]
dt.investor.50 <- dt.startup.invest[investor %in% l.investor.startup.50,]

# Create vertices
all.investors <- dt.investor.50[, list(name = unique(investor), type=TRUE)]
all.startups <- dt.investor.50[, list(name = unique(Company), type=FALSE)]
all.vertices <- rbind(all.investors, all.startups)

# Create graph
g <- graph.data.frame(dt.investor.50[, list(Company, investor)], directed = FALSE, vertices = all.vertices)

V(g)$type <- bipartite_mapping(g)$type
plot(g, vertex.size = 6, vertex.label = NA)     

sprintf('There are %d investments', gsize(g))

```
#### Connectivity of startups

They are connected, if they have **at least one investor** in common.
```{r}
# Subset data
dt.investors.50 <- dt.investor.50 %>%
  group_by(Company)%>%
  summarize(investors = list(investor)) %>%
  unique()
startup.investor.names <- setNames(dt.investors.50$investors, dt.investors.50$Company)

# Create an empty graph
g.graph <- make_empty_graph(directed = FALSE)

# Add the movie nodes to the graph
g.graph <- add.vertices(g.graph, nv = length(dt.investors.50$Company), name = names(startup.investor.names))

# Add edges to the graph between movies that share an actor
for (i in 1:(length(startup.investor.names)-1)) {
  for (j in (i+1):length(startup.investor.names)) {
    if (length(intersect(startup.investor.names[[i]], startup.investor.names[[j]])) > 0) {
      g.graph <- add_edges(g.graph, c(i,j))
    }
  }
}

# Calculate the degree centrality for each movie
degree_centrality <- degree(g.graph, mode = "total")

# Remove movies with no connections to other movies
g.connect <- induced.subgraph(g.graph, which(degree_centrality > 0))

# Plot the graph
plot(g.connect, vertex.size = 6, edge.arrow.size = 0.1, vertex.label = NA)

# Centrality
centrality <- data.table(Node = V(g.connect)$name,
               Degree = degree(g.connect),
               Closeness = round(closeness(g.connect, normalized = TRUE), 4),
               Betweenness = round(betweenness(g.connect, normalized = TRUE), 4),
               Eigenvector = round(evcent(g.connect)$vector, 4))
head(centrality)

clust.coef <- transitivity(g.connect, type = "average")
sprintf('The average clustering coefficient for the startup network is %f', clust.coef)

```
```{r}
investor <- "6Sense"
scc <- neighbors(g.connect, investor)

# Create induced subgraph with nearest Interstellar neighbors
add.scc <- c(scc, V(g.connect)[investor])
g.investor <- induced.subgraph(g.connect, vids = add.scc)

# Plot the graph
plot(g.investor, vertex.size = 9, edge.arrow.size = 0.1, vertex.color = ifelse(V(g.investor)$name == investor, "salmon", "lightblue"), vertex.label = NA)

# Clustering coefficient
clust.coef <- transitivity(g.investor, type = "local", vids = investor)
sprintf('The local clustering coefficient of %s is %f', investor, clust.coef)
```
# Most participation of actors not participating in movie itself
dt.interstellar.neighbor <- data.table(movie = V(g.movie)$name)
dt.interstellar.neighbor <- merge(dt.interstellar.neighbor, dt.movie.actor, by = 'movie')

`%!in%` <- Negate(`%in%`)
actor.interstellar <- as.list(unlist((dt.interstellar.neighbor[movie == "Interstellar (2014)"])$actor))
dt.interstellar.neighbor <- dt.interstellar.neighbor[dt.interstellar.neighbor$actor %!in% actor.interstellar]

most.p.interstellar <- dt.interstellar.neighbor %>%
  group_by(actor) %>%
  summarize(interstellar_n_p = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(interstellar_n_p)) %>%
  head(1)
sprintf('The actor with the most participations in the network without participating in %s itself is %s with a total of %d participations', movie, most.p.interstellar$actor, most.p.interstellar$interstellar_n_p)
